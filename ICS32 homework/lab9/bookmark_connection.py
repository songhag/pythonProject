# This is a helper module that provides functions common to both client and server.

# So type annotations in python 3.10 and below are not capable of interpreting 
# type hints of methods that have parameters as the same type as the enclosing class.
# the following import gets us around that. Feel free to comment out to see
# the difference if you are in PyCharm or VS Code
